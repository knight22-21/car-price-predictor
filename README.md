# Project Report: car-price-predictor Using Linear Regression

# Overview

The Car Price Predictor is a machine learning project that utilizes linear regression to estimate car prices based on various features. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use tool for individuals and businesses looking to gauge the market value of vehicles based on historical data.

# Features
Predicts car prices based on features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.
Utilizes linear regression for accurate price estimations.
Easy-to-understand code structure for beginners and enthusiasts.
Sample data provided for testing and validation.

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)

# Model Training
The linear regression model is trained using the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Identify relevant features for predicting car prices.
Model Training: Fit the linear regression model using training data.

## Model Deployment
**Development Environment**
PyCharm: We used PyCharm for developing the Flask web application, which included writing, debugging, and testing the code.

## Hosting
**Connecting to Git Repository:** Integrated the app with a Git repository for continuous deployment.
**Configuration:** Set up deployment settings and environment variables on Render.
**Deployment:** Render handled the build and deployment, making the application accessible via a public URL.

# Conclusion

The project successfully developed and deployed a car price predictor using the Linear Regression algorithm. The model achieved high performance metrics and was effectively integrated into a user-friendly web application.

# Results
After training, the model can be evaluated using test data to check its accuracy. Visualizations of predicted vs actual prices are provided to help assess performance. The web application delivered real-time feedback and met the project goals effectively.
