# Project Report: car-price-predictor Using Linear Regression

# Overview

The Car Price Predictor is a machine learning project that utilizes linear regression to estimate car prices based on various features. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use tool for individuals and businesses looking to gauge the market value of vehicles based on historical data.

# Features
Predicts car prices based on features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.
Utilizes linear regression for accurate price estimations.
Easy-to-understand code structure for beginners and enthusiasts.
Sample data provided for testing and validation.

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)

# Model Training
The linear regression model is trained using the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Identify relevant features for predicting car prices.
Model Training: Fit the linear regression model using training data.

# Results
After training, the model can be evaluated using test data to check its accuracy. Visualizations of predicted vs actual prices are provided to help assess performance.
